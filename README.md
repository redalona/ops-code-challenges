- This repo is a combination of Powershell and Bash Script during our Ops and Cybersecurity 201 course code challenges lab.
## Why are you learning these skills?
- I am learning this skill because these coding languages are beginnner-friendly.
## What fundamental concepts did you learn in Ops 201?
- The proper steps to take when troubleshooting and fundamentals for writing and running scripts.
